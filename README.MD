# DATA SCIENCE PORTFOLIO
This repository contains a portfolio of Data Science Projects completed by me for hobby, academic and self-study purposes. Each of the projects is presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks inside GitHub landing page.

For a more enjoyable viewing experience when browsing the portfolio, visit [PORTFOLIO](https://www.estebangarnicamateus.github.io/web-portofolio).

Note: The data used in the projects (accessed in the data directory) is for demonstration purposes only.
